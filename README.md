The program will ask you for your Discord Token when you launch it for the first time, then it will work.

You can change your AI Pokedex token by clicking the "Change AI Token" button.

However, it will not recognize every pokémon that spawns because it uses [AIPokedex](aipokedex.com). You can find your [AIPokedex](aipokedex.com) token by logging on the website and copying it there. If you pay for premium, your token will be able to request for more pokémons.
